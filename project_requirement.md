**Documentation Requirements:**

**Project summary (Abstract)**

One page Word document in a separate file. Project summary should contain your name /team,  title of your project and URLs to YouTube video.
Produce a one page summary to describe the problem you are trying to solve, your data set, the particular technology topic or feature you are demonstrating, its uses, benefits, drawbacks, challenges and your results.  Describe briefly the working example you prepared. This first page is very important. Based on that page, your colleagues will judge whether to download your project and spend time reading your documentation and code. Please add YouTube / reference URLs  to the bottom of the one page summary. 

Filenames should be prefixed with team if appropriate and then topic (abbreviate project), followed by your name:
	- you must identify and list all team members in all of your FP files
	- you must prefix your final zip with label "Team" e.g. Team_ShortTopicName_YourLastNameYourFirstName_Final.zip

**Demo/solution implementation and working code (python notebook)**

Produce a single working demo that meets your problem statement and provides a full implementation of your solution.  You may not simply copy examples (demonstrations) of the technology that are online. (Grade will be 0).  You can use code skeletons that are provided as we have done in class and show your extended programming use of them.  Provide neatly organized and complete working code with comments. Please note that a project will not be given any points if a working implementation and code are missing. Please provide the URL to your full data source. If your data set is larger than 10MB, PLEASE DO NOT UPLOAD your data set. In such a case, please provide only a sample of your data with the rest of your submission. Our site has a limited capacity and a few large submissions could block it.
PLEASE, PLEASE do not upload final projects which take more than 20 MB of space. In the past we had students who would upload GBs of data and block Canvas site. We do not find such practical jokes amusing.

**Slides**

Produce a set of Power Point slides (10-20) with a few snapshots of your demo which captures the key points: your problem statement, what the technology does, your demonstration and pros/cons. The first page of your Power Point slide must have a standard format that we provide.  Please use white background for all your Power Point slides. White background makes slides readable, printable and presentable on YouTube. Place URLs of your YouTube videos on the last slide.  Note: The filename should start with the topic name followed by your name

**Report**

Produce a detailed document with a complete description of analyzed technology or use case including all installation and configuration steps. Your report will start with your name and project title. Detailed installations and configuration is required. Your colleagues must be able to reproduce your work based solely on the steps you have documented.  Describe your problem statement, data set, installation/configuration, results, what worked, what did not and why not, and any lessons learned. Report must show all steps to reproduce examples that you developed.  This report is similar to your homework solutions where all steps are described along with the results.
* The first page of your report should be the same as the one page summary (abstract). The first page should contain your name /  team (as appropriate list all team members) and the project topic name. 
* Please include your name and your project topic in the header or the footer of your MS Word Document. 
* Name your file like you named 1 page summary appended with `_report`.
* Please include page numbers. 
* You are welcome to upload a PDF version of all documents. However, you must always submit an MS Word version of your report. Just submitting a Jupyter notebook is not acceptable. You must create a written report in MS Word.
* Please include URLs for your YouTube videos at the end of your report

**2-minute YouTube presentation**

Produce a 2 minute YouTube presentation. This video will contain a summary of the technology and a quick overview of your demonstration. This video might get presented to the entire class so please make sure it is 2 minutes and not more. 

**Submission Instructions: **

`Image_Captioning_CaiTianyuan_Final.zip`
* Submit final project on the course site. 
* Files to be submitted
	- Report, by itself
